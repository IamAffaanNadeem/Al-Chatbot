# AI Chatbot

Welcome to the **AI Chatbot** project! This repository contains a fully functional AI-powered chatbot built using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot is designed to provide intelligent responses to user queries, showcasing a smooth and responsive interface for interactive communication.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic UI**: Modern and responsive design built with HTML and CSS.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Instant responses powered by Python backend and JavaScript.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the chatbot's appearance or train it for specific use cases.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs seamlessly on web browsers with lightweight dependencies.
- **AI Integration**: Leveraging machine learning or pre-trained NLP models to enhance conversation quality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

1. **Python**:
   - Handles the chatbot's backend logic.
   - Integrates natural language processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK or OpenAI's GPT-3/4 API (if applicable).

2. **HTML & CSS**:
   - HTML: Structures the chatbot's interface.
   - CSS: Styles the chatbot for an attractive and user-friendly UI.

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Enables real-time interaction and communication with the backend.
   - Manages the user input/output flow.

## 🤖 How It Works

1. **Frontend**:
   - The user interface (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) collects user inputs and displays responses dynamically.

2. **Backend**:
   - Python processes user queries using AI models or APIs, sending the response back to the frontend.

3. **Communication**:
   - Data exchange between the frontend and backend occurs via HTTP requests (using AJAX or Fetch API).

---

## ✨ Customization

- **Styling**:
  Modify `styles.css` for a personalized look and feel.
  
- **AI Logic**:
  Adjust `chatbot_model.py` to integrate new AI models or train on custom datasets.

- **Add Features**:
  Use JavaScript to enhance interactivity or expand backend logic to handle specific tasks.
